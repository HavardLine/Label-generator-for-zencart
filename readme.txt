Hi There, this is a plugin made for zencart v1.5.0

The module makes ZPL files that is ment for zebra printers. We use the ZPL II standard. Please commit a more dynamic version if you have time.

This project is available at https://github.com/HavardLine/Label-generator-for-zencart

Installation:
- Edit LABEL_PRINT_FOLDER in admin/includes/extra_configures/extra_label_folder.php
- Edit admin/includes/languages/english/labelGenerator.php to fit your needs.
- Copy the content of admin/ to you ZenCart admin folder.


Use:
Files are printed to the folder you choose. You still have to make the printer eat these files.
